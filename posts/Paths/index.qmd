## Set system-wide PATH for Mac OS GUI applications

Problem: GUI applications often don't find an app when its directory is already in the PATH environnment variable.

In my case, I was unable to start `jupyter` from inside `Quarto`.

For recent Mac OS releases, the solution to the problem is easy:

Edit `/etc/paths` and add the needed paths. Restart your Finder. That's it.
