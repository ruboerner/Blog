# Welcome!

This is the first post in a Quarto blog.

## Why Quarto?

Recently, I discovered [Quarto](http://quarto.org), which offers a functionality that I was missing in other tools.

## What is Quarto?

First and foremost, using Quarto one can easily deploy a website, a blog post, a presentation, a static html page, or you name it.

This blog is a Quarto project which I edit in [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com).

Its sources are hosted at [GitHub](http://github.com/ruboerner/Blog) and deployed as a static site using GitHub Pages.
